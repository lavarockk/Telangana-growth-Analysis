Hello everyone,
I participated in codebasics Resume Challenge 7, which is to analyze growth and present insights to the Telangana government. Telangana government open sourced all the data and is accessible at Open Data Telangana. I would like to thank code basics team and the Telangana government for making this possible.
 
**Objective:**
Analyze the given data and provide insights to the Telangana government in the following departments.
1. Registration revenue
2. Transportation
3. TS-IPASS (Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self Certification System)
 
**Tools:**
1. Power BI for ETL process, analyzing, visualizing and dashboarding.
2. PowerPoint for presentation
3. MS Excel for cross validation of data.
 
**Key insights:**
1. Since the implementation of E-stamp challan in Dec2020, the revenue has been growing steadily.
2. Covid19 has impacted negatively on all transportation, stamp revenue, investments.
3. Investments in the FY 2019 were around 41K crores. After a huge decline in 2020, there is a steady improvement and in FY 2022 alone the investments are 26K crores.
4. The vehicle sales have declined consistently from FY 2019 to FY 2022. However electric vehicles have increased in FY 2022.
5. Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal_Malkajgiri, Sangareddy districts are top districts in transportation, stamp revenue and investments.
