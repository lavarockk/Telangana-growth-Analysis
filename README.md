Hello everyone,
I am excited to participate in codebasics Resume Challenge 7, which is to analyze growth and present insights to the Telangana government. Telangana government open sourced all the data and is accessible at Open Data Telangana. I would like to thank code basics team and the Telangana government for making this possible.
 
**Objective:**
Analyze the given data and provide insights to the Telangana government in the following departments.
1. Registration revenue

**Tools:**
